## Introduction

The Library Management System is a full-stack web application designed to facilitate the management of books and members within a library environment. It aims to simplify the processes of browsing, borrowing, and returning books, as well as managing member information.

## Functionality

1. **Explore All Books**: Users can view a list of all available books in the library. This list includes essential details about each book, such as title, author, and availability status.

2. **Import Book from Frappe Library URL**: The application enables users to import book details directly from the Frappe Library URL. This feature streamlines the process of adding new books to the system.

3. **View Each Book**: Users can access detailed information about individual books, including their cover images, descriptions, and availability status.

4. **Issue and Return Books**: The system allows users to issue books to library members and subsequently process their return. This functionality helps in tracking the borrowing history of books.

5. **Add New Member**: Users with appropriate permissions can add new members to the library system. Member details, such as name, contact information, and membership ID, can be recorded.
